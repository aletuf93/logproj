abstract = {This text serves well as a follow-on text to Python Programming Fundamentals by Kent D. Lee and published by Springer, but does not require you to have read that text. In this text the next steps are taken to teach you how to handle large amounts of data efficiently. A number of algorithms are introduced and the need for them is motivated through examples that bring meaning to the problems we face as computer programmers. An algorithm is a well-defined procedure for accom- plishing a task. Algorithms are an important part of Computer Science and this text explores many algorithms to give you the background you need when writing programs of your own. The goal is that having seen some of the sorts of algorithms presented in this text, you will be able to apply these techniques to other programs you write in the future. Another goal of this text is to introduce you to the idea of computational complexity. While there are many unique and interesting algorithms that we could explore, it is important to understand that some algorithms are more efficient than others. While computers are very good at doing calculations quickly, an inefficient algorithm can make the fastest computer seem very slow or even make it appear to come to a halt. This text will show you what can and cannot be computed effi- ciently. The text builds this idea of efficiency from the most basic of facts giving you the tools you will need to determine just how efficient any algorithm is so you can make informed judgements about the programs you write. v},

@book{Hull2016,
abstract = {This article outlines how the power perspectice can enhance effective procurement and supply chain management. The first section outlines the current dominant view of competence in procurement and supply chain management and explains why it is incomplete. The second section explains why competence in procurement and supply chain management must start from an understanding of the bases of supplier power and busines strategy. This section also explains the critical role of buying as one of the two main competences that all organizations require if they seek business success. The final section outlines the basic power matrix that is essential in understanding the exchange relationship between buyers and suppliers, so that buyers can understand the circumstance they are in and what scope exists for the to augment their power relative to suppliers.},
