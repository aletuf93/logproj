Email: Rob.Kitchin{\{}at{\}}nuim.ie$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines. In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory', the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology.},

abstract = {Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions are scrambling to put together data-science programs, and publications are touting data science as a hot—even ‘‘sexy''—career choice. However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science.},

@article{Mortenson2015,
abstract = {The growing attention and prominence afforded to analytics presents a genuine challenge for the operational research community. Many in the community have recognised this growth and sought to align themselves with analytics. For instance, the US operational research society INFORMS now offers analytics related conferences, certification and a magazine. However, as shown in this research, the volume of analytics-orientated studies in journals associated with operational research is comparatively low. This paper seeks to address this paradox by seeking to better understand what analytics is, and how operational research is related to it. To do so literature from a range of academic disciplines is analysed, in what is conceived as concurrent histories in the shared tradition of a management paradigm spread over the last 100 years. The findings of this analysis reveal new insights as to how operational research exists within an ecosystem shared with several other disciplines, and how interactions and ripple effects diffuse knowledge and ideas between each. Whilst this ecosystem is developed and evolved through interdisciplinary collaborations, individual disciplines are cast into competition for the attention of the same business users. These findings are further explored by discussing the implication this has for operational research, as well as considering what directions future research may take to maximise the potential value of these relationships.},

abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

abstract = {Product forecasts are a critical input into sourcing, procurement, production, inventory, logistics, finance and marketing decisions. Numerous quantitative models have been developed and applied to generate and improve product forecasts. The use of human judgement, either solely or in conjunction with quantitative models, has been well researched in the academic literature and is a popular forecasting approach in industry practice. In the context of judgemental forecasting, methods that integrate an expert's judgement into quantitative forecasting models are commonly referred to as “integrating forecasting” methods. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature of judgemental demand forecasting with a focus placed on integrating methods. We explore the role of expert opinion and contextual information and discuss the application of behaviourally informed support systems. We also provide important directions for further research in these areas.},

Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses the evolution of decision support systems (DSS) and their close relationship with the business intelligence arena. Open source and commercial BI products are also identified. Findings – The data that are accessed by BI applications must be accurate if managers of knowledge enterprises  are  to  make  informed  decisions.  Effective  partnerships  for  business  and  information entities  should  be  observed  when  BI  tools  are  introduced  to  an  enterprise.  Buy-in  from  top management is absolutely necessary for the successful implementation of BI tools. Originality/value – The use of BI applications aids a knowledge enterprise by promoting efficiency within an organization, particularly by using analytical methods to provide valuable decision-making knowledge to minimize operating costs and to accurately forecast market trends.

This has provided an impetus for organizations to adopt and perfect data analytic functions (e.g. data science, predictive analytics, and big data) in order to enhance supply chain processes and, ultimately, performance. However, management decisions informed by the use of these data analytic methods are only as good as the data on which they are based. In this paper, we introduce the data quality problem in the context of supply chain management (SCM) and propose methods for monitoring and controlling data quality. In addition to advocating for the importance of addressing data quality in supply chain research and practice, we also highlight interdisciplinary research topics based on complementary theory. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Bertsimas2014,
abstract = {In this paper, we combine ideas from machine learning (ML) and operations research and management science (OR/MS) in developing a framework, along with specific methods, for using data to prescribe optimal decisions in OR/MS problems. In a departure from other work on data-driven optimization and reflecting our practical experience with the data available in applications of OR/MS, we consider data consisting, not only of observations of quantities with direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand or returns, but predominantly of observations of associated auxiliary quantities. The main problem of interest is a conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect observations, where the joint probability distributions that specify the problem are unknown. We demonstrate that our proposed solution methods, which are inspired by ML methods such as local regression, CART, and random forests, are generally applicable to a wide range of decision problems. We prove that they are tractable and asymptotically optimal even when data is not iid and may be censored. We extend this to the case where decision variables may directly affect uncertainty in unknown ways, such as pricing's effect on demand. As an analogue to R{\^{}}2, we develop a metric P termed the coefficient of prescriptiveness to measure the prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy from an operations perspective. To demonstrate the power of our approach in a real-world setting we study an inventory management problem faced by the distribution arm of an international media conglomerate, which ships an average of 1bil units per year. We leverage internal data and public online data harvested from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Google to prescribe operational decisions that outperform baseline measures. Specifically, the data we collect, leveraged by our methods, accounts for an 88$\backslash${\%} improvement as measured by our P.},
