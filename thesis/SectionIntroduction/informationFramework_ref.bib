abstract = {Self-similar architectures simplify design and interoperability for smart manufacturing and logistics systems. Self-similar architectures for these domains extend existing models of self-similar controller architectures to include unified models, or abstractions, of plant behavior and planning and operational control functions. This paper proposes modeling system units as discrete event logistics systems (DELS), an abstraction that unifies heterogeneous system models for the manufacturing and logistics domain. Similar DELS then can be composed into self-similar architectures for larger, more complex DELS.},

@book{Hopp2011,
abstract = {Our economy and future way of life depend on how well American manufacturing managers adapt to the dynamic, globally competitive landscape and evolve their firms to keep pace. A major challenge is how to structure the firm's environment so that it attains the speed and low cost of high-volume flow lines while retaining the flexibility and customization potential of a low-volume job shop. The book's three parts are organized according to three categories of skills required by managers and engineers: basics, intuition, and synthesis. Part I reviews traditional operations management techniques and identifies the necessary components of the science of manufacturing. Part II presents the core concepts of the book, beginning with the structure of the science of manufacturing and a discussion of the systems approach to problem solving. Other topics include behavioral tendencies of manufacturing plants, push and pull production systems, the human element in operations management, and the relationship between quality and operations. Chapter conclusions include main points and observations framed as “manufacturing laws.” In Part III, the lessons of Part I and the “laws” of Part II are applied to address specific manufacturing management issues in detail. The authors compare and contrast common problems, including shop floor control, long-range aggregate planning, workforce planning and capacity management. A main focus in Part III is to help readers visualize how general concepts in Part II can be applied to specific problems. Written for both engineering and management students, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of a rule-based and data driven approach to operations planning and control. They advance an organized framework from which to evaluate management practices and develop useful intuition about manufacturing systems.},

@article{Spearman2014,
abstract = {The "Principle of Least Action" is the foundational principle of fundamental physics. Application of this principle to the supply chain naturally results in an "uncertainty principle" linking variation in production to variation in net-inventory. The model also provides an easy means of determining the stationary distribution of net-inventory for a variety of control strategies. The formalism results in a control strategy that outperforms commonly used control methods. {\textcopyright} 2014 Production and Operations Management Society.},
