abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. Operations and supply chain management encompasses a vast domain and hence provides a myriad of opportunities for huge voluminous data generated from various sources in real time. Such huge data having the requisite properties of big data can be utilised to gain critical and fundamental insights towards optimising the operations and supply chain and thus making effective and efficient decisions. In the recent years, research interest in big data has increased substantially and therefore researchers and practitioners have also tried to tap the capabilities of big data to optimise operations and supply chain management. In this paper, the literature relating to the integration of big data with operations and supply chain management is reviewed. In particular, reviewing past work is primarily focused on three key areas of the operations and supply chain management, namely manufacturing, procurement and logistics where big data has been applied. In addition to reviewing past literature, paper also proposes application of big data in operations and supply chain management.},

abstract = {Planning the transport of maritime containers from the seaport to final inland destinations is challenged by uncertainties regarding the time the container is released for further transport and the transit time from the port to its final destination. This paper assesses the value of information in container transport in terms of efficiency and reliability. The analysis uses a stylized single period model where a decision maker allocates released containers to two transport modes (slow, low price, no flexible departure times versus fast, high price, flexible departure times) and plans the departure time of the inflexible mode. We construct Pareto frontiers and the corresponding Pareto optimal decisions under various information scenarios and show that the Pareto frontiers move in a favorable direction when the level of information increases. The mathematical results are explained and illustrated by means of a numerical example involving barge transport. We also perform a sensitivity analysis and study the impact of erroneous information on efficiency and reliability based on a numerical analysis. 2015 INFORMS.},

abstract = {The emergence of novel and powerful digital technologies, digital platforms and digital infrastructures has transformed innovation and entrepreneurship in significant ways. Beyond simply opening new opportunities for innovators and entrepreneurs, digital technologies have broader implications for value creation and value capture. Research aimed at understanding the digital transformation of the economy needs to incorporate multiple and cross-levels of analysis, embrace ideas and concepts from multiple fields/disciplines, and explicitly acknowledge the role of digital technologies in transforming organizations and social relationships. To help realize this research agenda, we identify three key themes related to digitization—openness, affordances, and generativity—and, outline broad research issues relating to each. We suggest that such themes that are innate to digital technologies could serve as a common conceptual platform that allows for connections between issues at different levels as well as the integration of ideas from different disciplines/areas. We then summarize the contributions of the 11 papers presented in this Special Issue relating them to one or more of these themes and outlining their implications for future research.},

Product platforms, which are component and subsystem assets shared across a product-family, enable a firm to better leverage investments in product design and development. While the platform approach offers a number of benefits, it also imposes certain additional costs that have not received adequate research attention. In this paper, we use an industrial example both to illustrate some of the costs and benefits of platform-based product development and to motivate the development of a mathematical model. The model is formulated to better understand the appropriateness of product platforms and their impact on product-planning decisions.

abstract = {We describe an equilibrium model of peer-to-peer product sharing, or collaborative consumption, where individuals with varying usage levels make decisions about whether or not to own. Owners are able to generate income from renting their products to non-owners while non-owners are able to access these products through renting on as needed basis. We characterize equilibrium outcomes, including ownership and usage levels, consumer surplus, and social welfare. We compare each outcome in systems with and without collaborative consumption and examine the impact of various problem parameters including rental price, platform's commission fee, cost of ownership, owner's moral hazard cost, and renter's inconvenience cost. Our findings indicate that, depending on the rental price, collaborative consumption can result in either lower or higher ownership and usage levels, with higher ownership and usage levels more likely when the cost of ownership is high. We show that consumers always benefit from collaborative consumption, with individuals who, in the absence of collaborative consumption, are indifferent between owning and not owning benefiting the most. We also show that the platform's profit is not monotonic in the cost of ownership, implying that a platform is least profitable when the cost of ownership is either very high or very low. },

We study the role of surge pricing (dynamically raising the price at a particular location above the regular price) in managing worker availability across market locations, explicitly accounting for how workers strategically move between locations. We show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, surge pricing can be useful even at locations with excess supply of workers to improve worker availability across locations. Specifically, because workers face costs to move and competition from others who move, simply informing workers about where they are needed is not sufficient to ensure that enough workers move to that location. Surge pricing at a location with excess supply of workers lowers workers' revenue potential of serving that location, and hence can induce more workers to move to where they are needed. Even though such surge pricing reduces platform profit at the location where it is used, it can increase total platform profit across locations, and can even be more profitable than offering workers bonuses to move. Surge pricing at a location with excess supply may also serve as a credible signal of higher demand for workers to move. It may also be used to avoid too many workers from flocking to a location with shortage of workers.

abstract = {W e examine whether ownership of intellectual property rights (IPR) or downstream capabilities is effective in encouraging entry into markets complementary to a proprietary platform by preventing the platform owner from expropriating rents from start-ups. We study this question in the context of the software industry, an environment where evidence of the efficacy of IPR as a mechanism to appropriate the returns from innovation has been mixed. Entry, in our context, is measured by an independent software vendor's (ISV's) decision to become certified by a platform owner and produce applications compatible with the platform. We find that ISVs with a greater stock of formal IPR (such as patents and copyrights), and those with stronger downstream capabilities (as measured by trademarks and consulting services) are more likely to join the platform, suggesting that these mechanisms are effective in protecting ISVs from the threat of expropriation. We also find that the effects of IPR on the likelihood of partnership are greater when an ISV has weak downstream capabilities or when the threat of imitation is greater, such as when the markets served by the ISV are growing quickly.},

A decision support system outlined here leverages the 3PL provider's historical shipment data along with its knowledge of both sides of the shipping process to increase profits and to better perform the pricing and sourcing tasks. At the core of the system are discrete choice models for shippers and carriers along with a profit maximization model. The discrete choice models predict the acceptance or rejection of an offer for a shipment to shippers and a bid for capacity to carriers. The profit maximization model determines the shipper price that maximizes the 3PL provider's expected profit. In addition to those models are procedures for determining a list of potential carriers for an incoming shipment and also for ranking those carriers. As its main outputs, the system produces a shipper price and a ranked carrier list. The system is applied to real-world data provided by a 3PL company, with excellent results. The system is able to produce competitive yet profitable prices and to select potential carriers that would increase the 3PL provider's profits.},

They can be utilised by transport and supply chain managers to assess what is happening within their supply chains, how well they are performing and the degree of integration, especially of the transport function with related supply chain echelons. It is hoped that by codifying this element of the research a contribution will have been made to the effective dissemination of the research to industry and thought leaders, which in turn will lead to practical exploitation, resulting in more integrated transport and supply chain management practice.},

@article{Pani2014,
abstract = {One of the most important issues in Transhipment Container Terminal (TCT) management is to have fairly reliable and affordable predictions about vessel arrival. Terminal operators need to estimate the actual time of arrival in port in order to determine the daily demand for each work shift with greater accuracy. In this way, the resources required (human resources, equipment as well as spatial resources) can be allocated more efficiently. Despite contractual obligations to notify the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) 24 hours before arrival, ship operators often have to revise it due to unexpected events like weather conditions, delay in a previous port and so on. For planners the decision-making processes related to this topic can sometimes be so complex without the support of suitable methodological tools. Specific models should be adopted, in a daily planning scenario, to provide a useful support tool in TCTs. In this study, we discuss an exploratory analysis of the data affecting delays registered at a Mediterranean TCT. We present some preliminary results obtained using data mining techniques and propose a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model to reduce the range of uncertainty of ship arrivals in port. This approach is compulsory to manage vast amounts of unstructured data involved in estimating of vessel arrivals.},

abstract = {Returnable container networks have caught the eye of those companies that aim to reduce waste generation and environmental impact. The literature already includes studies on the environmental impact (i.e. Life Cycle Assessment, LCA) of these networks. However, the major part is based on secondary data since the collection of primary data is complex and time-intensive. This paper proposes an object-relational database dedicated to the storage of data from a closed-loop reusable plastic crates (RPC) networks for fruits and vegetables. The goal is supporting scholars and managers during the LCA through a user-friendly data architecture, while suggesting structured guidelines for the primary data collection. Each node of the RPC network is characterized by a similar set of entity types, such as machines, which allows to process the RPCs with respect to specific cycles. Each entity, process and cycle are therefore reflected in the database by objects that are connected with relations.},

@article{Baruffaldi2019b,
abstract = {This chapter explores the processes of a typical logistics network for the management of reusable packaging for food products. While the impacts associated with packaging waste in the food sector are well known, the adoption of reusable crates or handling systems for food items entails many logistics processes such as storage, transportation, and cleaning, whose impact needs to be quantified and assessed with cost-benefit analysis. This chapter thus presents a methodology and a decision-support tool used to quantify the logistic and environmental impacts associated with packaging distribution in the closed-loop network between growers, retailers, and the pooler. This methodology allows quantifying of the performance of the as-is scenario and predicting the savings of choosing intermodal transport solutions (i.e., railways, seaways) for the delivery and collection of reusable plastic crates (RPCs) for fruits and vegetables. The methodology is applied to a multiscenario what-if analysis of a case study provided by an Italian pooler operating in the retail food supply chain. The results are generated through a decision-support tool, which embeds a geographic information system (GIS) and realizes data-driven assessment of storage and distribution operations experienced by RPCs. We quantified some categories of impacts among the set of greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs) resulting from transportation and associated costs. The results showcase a total transportation cost reduction of 11.7{\%} in the to-be scenario, while the number of kilograms of CO2eq decreases by 9.2{\%}. The contribution of this chapter lies in the investigation of the environmental sustainability of a packaging closed-loop network (CLN) for food products. Moreover, we decided to limit the boundaries of the analysis to the transport process, which is often neglected and underrated in typical life cycle assessment (LCA). Findings from this chapter represent practical suggestions and strategic guidelines for managers and practitioners of reusable package systems toward more sustainable operations.},

abstract = {Multiple seasonal patterns play a key role in time series forecasting, especially for business time series where seasonal effects are often dramatic. Previous approaches including Fourier decomposition, exponential smoothing, and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models do not reflect the distinct characteristics of each period in seasonal patterns, such as the unique behavior of specific days of the week in business data. We propose a multi-dimensional hierarchical model. Intermediate parameters for each seasonal period are first estimated, and a mixture of intermediate parameters is then taken, resulting in a model that successfully reflects the interactions between multiple seasonal patterns. Although this process reduces the data available for each parameter, a robust estimation can be obtained through a hierarchical Bayesian model implemented in Stan. Through this model, it becomes possible to consider both the characteristics of each seasonal period and the interactions among characteristics from multiple seasonal periods. Our new model achieved considerable improvements in prediction accuracy compared to previous models, including Fourier decomposition, which Prophet uses to model seasonality patterns. A comparison was performed on a real-world dataset of pallet transport from a national-scale logistic network.},

abstract = {The manufacturing base in the Pearl River Delta of China is moving westwards, where the Pearl River system has extensive coverage. This makes container barge transport a new growth area for Hong Kong Port. Traditionally, Hong Kong Port has been the main gateway for containers transported through the Pearl River system, but this advantageous position is under challenge from the adjacent ports in South China, especially from Shenzhen Port, which is keen to take a bigger share of the new growth by improving the access of barges to its port facilities. While services at Shenzhen Port are improving, barge operators have been experiencing high congestion at Hong Kong Port. Improving the quality of barge container services becomes crucial for Hong Kong Port. In this study, we propose and investigate three improvement strategies: to enhance the consolida- tion of small container flows, to increase the efficiency of berth allocations for barges, and to optimize the overall utilization of port resources in Hong Kong. These strategies can be instrumental for keeping Hong Kong's status as the gateway for the Pearl River system and help maintain its competitiveness as an international shipping hub. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {During the past decade intermodal barge transport has been very successful in gaining market share in northwest Europe. The barge sector has been able to cater very well to the ever-increasing demands of shippers. It is now a leading mode of transport along the major river corridors and is opening new geographical markets. These successful developments are due to the beneficial cost-quality features of intermodal barge transport compared with its main competitor, unimodal road transport. However, to remain competitive in existing markets and to expand into new market areas the cost-quality features of intermodal barge transport must be improved. Network operations are important influences on the cost-quality performance. Which barge network operations provide the best performance, however, depends on the transport market to be served. This relation between barge network design, transport market, and the performance of intermodal barge transport is the central issue discussed. A general framework for barge network design is presented describing the design variables for barge networks and showing their relationship to the performance indicators of intermodal barge transport. Given the quantitative relations between the design variables for barge networks, it is possible to assess the performance of different types of barge networks for different transport markets. This tool is empirically demonstrated in a case study on the Rhine River. It demonstrates that changing the network operations will lead to further improvement of the competitiveness of intermodal barge transport in this corridor.},
