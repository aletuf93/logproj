abstract = {This engaging and clearly written textbook/reference provides a must-have introduction to the rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field of data science. It focuses on the principles fundamental to becoming a good data scientist and the key skills needed to build systems for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. The Data Science Design Manual is a source of practical insights that highlights what really matters in analyzing data, and provides an intuitive understanding of how these core concepts can be used. The book does not emphasize any particular programming language or suite of data-analysis tools, focusing instead on high-level discussion of important design principles. This easy-to-read text ideally serves the needs of undergraduate and early graduate students embarking on an "Introduction to Data Science" course. It reveals how this discipline sits at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and machine learning, with a distinct heft and character of its own. Practitioners in these and related fields will find this book perfect for self-study as well. Additional learning tools: Contains "War Stories," offering perspectives on how data science applies in the real world Includes "Homework Problems," providing a wide range of exercises and projects for self-study Provides a complete set of lecture slides and online video lectures at www.data-manual.com Provides "Take-Home Lessons," emphasizing the big-picture concepts to learn from each chapter Recommends exciting "Kaggle Challenges" from the online platform Kaggle Highlights "False Starts," revealing the subtle reasons why certain approaches fail Offers examples taken from the data science television show "The Quant Shop" (www.quant-shop.com). What is Data Science? -- Mathematical Preliminaries -- Data Munging -- Scores and Rankings -- Statistical Analysis -- Visualizing Data -- Mathematical Models -- Linear Algebra -- Linear and Logistic Regression -- Distance and Network Methods -- Machine Learning -- Big Data: Achieving Scale.},

abstract = {This accessible and classroom-tested textbook/reference presents an introduction to the fundamentals of the emerging and interdisciplinary field of data science. The coverage spans key concepts adopted from statistics and machine learning, useful techniques for graph analysis and parallel programming, and the practical application of data science for such tasks as building recommender systems or performing sentiment analysis. Topics and features: Provides numerous practical case studies using real-world data throughout the book Supports understanding through hands-on experience of solving data science problems using Python Describes techniques and tools for statistical analysis, machine learning, graph analysis, and parallel programming Reviews a range of applications of data science, including recommender systems and sentiment analysis of text data Provides supplementary code resources and data at an associated website{\textless}This practically-focused textbook provides an ideal introduction to the field for upper-tier undergraduate and beginning graduate students from computer science, mathematics, statistics, and other technical disciplines. The work is also eminently suitable for professionals on continuous education short courses, and to researchers following self-study courses.
