abstract = {Paper summarising the (then) newly published BPMN. The language core consists of objects (events, decisions, activities) and connections (sequence and message flow, associations) alongside swimlanes (for organisational division) and a few miscellaneous artificats. This is a language for process modelling, but also includes business logic and is particularly helpful when considering large but modular organisations and workflows.},
