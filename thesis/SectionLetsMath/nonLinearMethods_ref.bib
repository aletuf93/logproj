In this paper, two implementation methods are introduced in detail. The detailed implementation of the second methods is based on S7-1200PLC, and the algorithm is applied to the temperature detection experiment. SIMULINK model and simulation results were compared, show that the Kalman filter in PLC to a certain extent can be achieved, and can very good filtering PLC analog data acquisition module with all kinds of disturbance, increase in measurement accuracy from the enhanced control effect to test the ideal.},

@article{Fang2018,
abstract = {This article presents an up-to-date tutorial review of nonlinear Bayesian estimation. State estimation for nonlinear systems has been a challenge encountered in a wide range of engineering fields, attracting decades of research effort. To date, one of the most promising and popular approaches is to view and address the problem from a Bayesian probabilistic perspective, which enables estimation of the unknown state variables by tracking their probabilistic distribution or statistics U+0028 e.g., mean and covariance U+0029 conditioned on a system U+02BC s measurement data. This article offers a systematic introduction to the Bayesian state estimation framework and reviews various Kalman filtering U+0028 KF U+0029 techniques, progressively from the standard KF for linear systems to extended KF, unscented KF and ensemble KF for nonlinear systems. It also overviews other prominent or emerging Bayesian estimation methods including Gaussian filtering, Gaussian-sum filtering, particle filtering and moving horizon estimation and extends the discussion of state estimation to more complicated problems such as simultaneous state and parameter U+002F input estimation.},
