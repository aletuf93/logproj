@book{Sauter2002,
abstract = {The highly anticipated new edition of the market-leading introduction to strategic management from Bob de Wit (Maastricht School of Management) and Ron Meyer (TiasNimbas Business School). Widely acclaimed for its ability to foster creative, non-prescriptive and global strategic thinking amongst students, Strategy 4e builds on the major international success of the prior edition. Developed from wide-ranging market feedback, all of the short and long cases have been replaced or wholly updated with dozens of new cases crafted by the authors and several international contributors. From Google to KPMG, ING Direct to the Metropolitan Opera, the text now features an unparalleled range of organizations with rich settings for students to develop key strategy skills and understanding. New readings, including coverage of hot topics like Blue Ocean Strategy, ensure the theory remains cutting-edge, while a boosted set of lecturer resources makes this the complete package for 21st century strategy courses.},
