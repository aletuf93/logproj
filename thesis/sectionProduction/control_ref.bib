@article{Syntetos2005,
abstract = {The categorization of alternative demand patterns facilitates the selection of a forecasting method and it is an essential element of many inventory control software packages. The common practice in the inventory control software industry is to arbitrarily categorize those demand patterns and then proceed to select an estimation procedure and optimize the forecast parameters. Alternatively, forecasting methods can be directly compared, based on some theoretically quantified error measure, for the purpose of establishing regions of superior performance and then define the demand patterns based on the results. It is this approach that is discussed in this paper and its application is demonstrated by considering EWMA, Croston's method and an alternative to Croston's estimator developed by the first two authors of this paper. Comparison results are based on a theoretical analysis of the mean square error due to its mathematically tractable nature. The categorization rules proposed are expressed in terms of the average inter-demand interval and the squared coefficient of variation of demand sizes. The validity of the results is tested on 3000 real-intermittent demand data series comina from the automotive industry. {\textcopyright} 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lim2014,
abstract = {Small medium industries (SMIs) routinely face supply variations in their production cycle. Such firms are typically characterised by limited resources and insufficiency of funds. Thus, SMIs need simple solutions to cope with the production planning issues. Pinch analysis has been proven as a strategy for planning of efficient use of scarce resources. Recently, it has been extended to various production planning problems. In this paper, a simple novel graphical approach is proposed to address two common production planning problems in SMI's, which are warehouse space allocation and production capacity planning. Two industrial case studies are shown in this paper to illustrate the proposed approach.},

@article{Reinhardt2013,
abstract = {The largest airports have a daily average throughput of more than 500 passengers with reduced mobility. The problem of transporting these passengers is in some cases a multi-modal transportation problem with synchronization constraints. A description of the problem together with a mathematical model is presented. The objective is to schedule as many of the passengers as possible, while ensuring a smooth transport with short waiting times. A simulated annealing based heuristic for solving the problem is presented. The algorithm makes use of an abstract representation of a candidate solution which in each step is transformed to an actual schedule by use of a greedy heuristic. Local search is performed on the abstract representation using advanced neighborhoods which modify large parts of the candidate solution. Computational results show that the algorithm is able to find good solutions within a couple of minutes, making the algorithm applicable for dynamic scheduling. Moreover high-quality solutions can be obtained by running the algorithm for 10 minutes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
