abstract = {This paper describes a new algorithm which has been developed for forming component families and machine groups for cellular manufacture by progressively restructuring the machine component matrix. The method allows interaction from the user when exceptions and overlap between groups cause the iterative algorithm to prematurely stop. This is an effective and efficient approach which offers great flexibility in determining the optimum families and groups. The algorithm is specifically designed for computer use in dealing with large amounts of data obtainable in realistic situations, although the procedures are simple, and can be carried out manually for the analysis of small machine component matrices. {\textcopyright} 1982, Society of Manufacturing Engineers and Computer and Automated Systems Association of SME.

abstract = {Data on the presence or absence of 25 fish species in a survey of 52 lakes from the watersheds of the Black and Hollow rivers of S- central Ontario were analyzed with 8 similarity coefficients. Co-occurrence coefficients reflect a general size effect similar to that commonly found in principal-components analysis. Measures of association and Ochiai's coefficient incorporate implicit centering transformations that reduce the size influence associated with the frequency of occurrence. Cluster analyses using co-occurrence coefficients are most susceptible to this size effect. The interpretations of many dendrograms fail to recognize size effects that arise from employing non-centered similarity coefficients. Arguments contrasting phenetic and phylogenetic methods may unknowingly debate the utility of centered versus non-centered coefficients, since the size effect undoubtedly contributes to the apparent strength of phylogenetic approaches. -from Authors},

Zool. 25:251–259.—A set of intuitively obvious properties of a coefficient of similarity for binary data is established. Critical examination of the coefficients available from the literature shows that none of them satisfies all these properties, and a new coefficient is proposed to obviate this inconvenience. The distribution of the new coefficient is studied on very large, perfectly random samples of OTU'S, and a table is constructed to show its critical values at different significance levels. A mathematical appendix is given to demonstrate the procedure used to construct perfectly random samples of different size. {\textcopyright} 1976 Society of Systematic Zoology.},

In this paper, we compare the performance of 20 well-known similarity coefficients. Two hundred and fourteen numerical cell formation problems, which are selected from the literature or generated deliberately, are used for the comparative study. Nine performance measures are used for evaluating the goodness of cell formation solutions. Two characteristics, discriminability and stability of the similarity coefficients are tested under different data conditions. From the results, three similarity coefficients are found to be more discriminable. Jaccard is found to be the most stable similarity coefficient. Four similarity coefficients are not recommendable due to their poor performances. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Specifically designed for Landsat (formerly ERTS) imagery, it is also suitable for other satellites with broader scans. Formulas are given for both sphere and ellipsoid. A unique feature is the need for a curved groundtrack and skewed scan lines on the SOM projection, although they would be straight and parallel, respectively, on a normal oblique cylindrical projection.},

abstract = {"Facility location applications are concerned with the location of one or more facilities in a way that optimizes a certain objective such as minimizing transportation cost, providing equitable service to customers, capturing the largest market share, etc. Facility location problems give rise to challenging geometrical and combinatorial problems. The research on facility location problems spans many research fields such as operations research/management science, industrial engineering, geography, economics, computer science, mathematics, marketing, electrical engineering, urban planning, and related fields. Applications to facility location models abound. Location of warehouses, plants, hospitals, retail outlets are classical examples. Applications are also found in the location of electronical components, warning sirens, sprinklers, radar beams, exploratory oil wells. These are less obvious "facilities". One should consider applying a location model to any scenario that involves finding a best location (or locations) for any object(s). This book Facility Location: A Survey of Applications and Methods provides a state of the art review along with references to important contemporary topics in locational analysis. The book includes twenty chapters divided into four parts, each dealing with a different aspect of location modeling and implementation. The book concludes with over 1,200 references. The first part Methodology and Analysis consists of a survey of methodological and technical aspects of location analysis. Issues such as estimating distances, the error introduced by assuming discrete demand rather than continuous one, global optimization techniques, inference of weights, con jugate duality, and using Voronoi diagrams are reviewed."--Publisher.

abstract = {Recent Enterprise CPM developments focus upon activities and away from the relationships between activities that was the hallmark of the original ADM and PERT methodologies. This paper proposes a system to address these issues, designated as RDM or Relationship Diagramming Method. RDM documents the reason for a restraint between two activities. It expands the types of relationships, distinguishing partial performance, passage of time and a new "concurrent relationship." The RDM algorithm provides trend durations based upon actual performance to date and an automated assignment of optimistic and pessimistic durations for an integrated Monte Carlo analysis. ADM was developed in 1956 and PERT in 1958 based largely upon the limitations of computers of that era. PDM was developed using the more, but still limited power of computers in 1964. RDM provides for better planning and scheduling than traditional or current implementations of CPM using the computers of the 21st century.},

The 66 studies reviewed in this article give inadequate information on the losses of many other vitamins. In cook/chill foodservices, substantial losses of sensitive vitamins occur during each of the chilling, storage, and reheating stages. Different, reheating methods have similar effects on the amount of vitamin retention. Losses of vitamin C and folate can be greater than 30{\%} when food is reheated after storage for 24 hours at 3°C. Current research indicates that under normal operating conditions, with hot-holding limited to less than 90 minutes, vitamin retention is better in a conventional foodservice than in a cook/chill system.},
