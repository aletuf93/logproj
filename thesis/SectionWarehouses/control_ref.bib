abstract = {Warehouse building design tackles the industrial is-sue of best studying the overall configuration and dimensions of the storage systems reaching one or more predefined target of performance. This paper proposes a multi-objective model for the warehouse building design to minimize the cycle time, the total cost, and the carbon footprint of the storage system over its lifetime. The goal is to define the overall building dimensions, addressing the target storage capacity and the han-dling performances, balancing the aforementioned three objec-tive functions. The cycle time computes the average duration of the pickup and drop-off activities, while the system total cost and carbon footprint rise over the entire warehouse lifetime, including the installation and operating phases. The developed model is applied to design the warehouse for an Italian food and beverage company. Results highlight that the total cost and the carbon footprint functions lead to similar warehouse con-figurations distinguished by a compact vertical structure. On the contrary, the cycle time function takes advantage of a flatter and wider building even if a dramatic increase of the environ-mental (+40{\%}) and cost (+10{\%}) objective functions occurs. The proposed best balance solution limits the total cost and carbon footprint increment below 1{\%} compared to their single-objective optima, while the cycle time worsening is lim-ited to 4{\%} compared to the optimal cycle time solution.

abstract = {A mathematical model is formulated to capture the impact of item, equipment, storage configuration and operating parameters in less than unit load orderpicking systems. Storage area material flow models based on lot size reorder point policies are integrated with orderpicking travel time models to generate aggregate retrieval area space requirements for randomized storage systems. These results are used to develop cycle time models for single and dual command orderpicking transactions and to evaluate the impact of alternative interleaving disciplines on system performance. The combined model is applied to predict the operating performance of a lot size, reorder point stock management system with respect to item retrieval throughput capacity, physical storage space requirements, inventory service level and system responsiveness. A sample problem is used to illustrate the application of the model as a design tool in measuring the impact of alternative design and operating scenarios on expected system performance.},

abstract = {As the supply chains get more complex, the variety of indicators and tools to measure warehouse performance has also increased. Furthermore, the metrics that are used for performance evaluation are assessed in different manners and hence there is not clear definition for some of these metrics. To address these issues, this literature review focuses on operational warehouse performance measurement, for which the warehouse managers need to carry out periodic analysis. Using the content analysis method, performance indicators are acquired from selected papers and are classified according to time, cost, quality and productivity dimensions. The contributions of this literature review are as follows: we present a synthesis of the literature on operational warehouse performance, we provide the definitions for the performance indicators and a framework to demonstrate their boundaries and, finally, based on the literature analysis, we also provide some discussions on current trends in warehouses and propose future research directions on warehouse performance evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Warehouses deliver labor-intensive services to customers. Underperformance may result in high costs and unsatisfied customer demand. New market developments force warehouses to handle a large number of orders within tight time windows. To cope with this, order picking operations need to be optimized by solving a wide range of planning problems. Optimizing order picking planning problems sequentially may yield a suboptimal overall warehouse performance. Still, previous warehouse planning reviews focus on individual planning problems. This literature review differs by investigating combinations of multiple order picking planning problems. A state-of-the-art review and classification of the scientific literature investigating combinations of tactical and operational order picking planning problems in picker-to-parts systems is presented with the aim of determining how planning problems are related. Furthermore, this literature review aims to find excellent policy combinations and to provide guidelines how warehouse managers can benefit from combining planning problems, in order to design efficient order picking systems and improve customer service. Combining multiple order picking planning problems results in substantial efficiency benefits, which are required to face new market developments.},

We solve the problem using an intelligent agent-based model. The modeling framework is between the two extremes of hierarchical and heterarchical frameworks. It recognizes that horizontal as well as vertical decisions are made between various levels of controllers and that these have to be captured explicitly in the model. Entities (goods or parts) and resources (storage areas and order pickers) are modeled as intelligent agents that function in a co-operative manner so as to accomplish individual as well as system-wide goals. Scheduling and other decisions are taken by these agents in a dynamic real-time fashion based on conditions that exist at the time these decisions are made. To overcome the structural rigidity and lack of flexibility, a negotiation mechanism for real time task allocation is used.},
