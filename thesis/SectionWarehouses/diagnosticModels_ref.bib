abstract = {This paper presents a literature review on Third-Party Logistics (3PL) selection decision in terms of criteria and methods. Based on the analysis of 67 articles published within 1994-2013 period, this review reveals that 3PL selection is empirical in nature and is related to a region/country, industrial sector, and logistics activities outsourced. In terms of 3PL selection criteria, 11 key criteria are identified; each one is defined by a set of attributes. Cost is the most widely adopted criterion, followed by relationship, services, and quality. In terms of methods for 3PL evaluation, they can be categorized in 5 groups, namely: MCDM techniques, statistical approaches, artificial intelligence, mathematical programming, and hybrid methods. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Accorsi2014,
abstract = {The issue of material handling involves the design and operative control of warehousing systems (i.e., distribution centres), which allow matching vendors and demands, smoothing with seasonality, consolidating products and arranging distribution activities. Warehousing systems play a crucial role in providing efficiency and customer satisfaction. The warehouse design entails a wide set of decisions, which involve layout constraints and operative issues that seriously affect the performances and the overall logistics costs. This study presents an original decision-support system (DSS) for the design, management, and control of warehousing systems. Specifically, the proposed DSS implements a top-down methodology that considers both strategic warehouse design and operative operations management. The DSS can simulate the logistics and material handling performances of a warehousing system. Heuristic methods and algorithms address several critical warehouse issues, such as the order picking process, which is responsible for 55{\%} of the overall costs in a distribution centre. The benefits due to the adoption of the proposed decision-support system are summarised as a dashboard of key performance indicators (KPIs) of space and time efficiency that allow logistics providers, practitioners, and managers as well as academicians and educators to face real-world warehousing instances and to find useful guidelines for material handling. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Throughput capacity models are comprised of picking policies, batching policies, storage assignment policies, as well as dynamic control models.

@article{Gray1992,
abstract = {A warehouse is a service facility, often comprising the only view that customers actually have of a manufacturing firm. The management of this facility has significant leverage over order leadtimes and fill-rate reliability. As with other service facilities, system design and operation are decision problems that are closely interlinked. In this paper we describe and model in general terms the composite design and operating problems for a typical order-consolidation warehouse. These problems include warehouse layout, equipment and technology selection, item location, zoning, picker routing, pick list generation and order batching. The complexity of the overall problem mandates developing a new multi-stage hierarchical decision approach. Our hierarchical approach utilizes a sequence of coordinated mathematical models to evaluate the major economic tradeoffs and to prune the decision space to a few superior alternatives. Detailed simulation employing actual warehousing data is then used for validation and fine tuning of the resulting design and operating policies. We describe the application of this analytical approach to an automotive spare-parts distribution centre. The case study demonstrates substantial savings in operating costs and highlights several generic management tradeoffs.},
