abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis GroupIn order to differentiate from competitors in terms of customer service, warehouses accept late orders while providing delivery in a quick and timely way. This trend leads to a reduced time to pick an order. This paper introduces workload forecasting in a warehouse context, in particular a zone picking warehouse. Improved workforce planning can contribute to an effective and efficient order picking process. Most order picking publications treat demand as known in advance. As warehouses accept late orders, the assumption of a constant given demand is questioned in this paper. The objective of this study is to present time series forecasting models that perform well in a zone picking warehouse. A real-life case study demonstrates the value of applying time series forecasting models to forecast the daily number of order lines. The forecast of order lines, along with order pickers' productivity, can be used by warehouse supervisors to determine the daily required number of order pickers, as well as the allocation of order pickers across warehouse zones. Time series are applied on an aggregated level, as well as on a disaggregated zone level. Both bottom-up and top-down approaches are evaluated in order to find the best-performing forecasting method.},

@article{Dotoli2015,
abstract = {The paper focuses on the analysis and optimization of production warehouses, proposing a novel approach to reduce inefficiencies which employs three lean manufacturing tools in an integrated and iterative framework. The proposed approach integrates the Unified Modeling Language (UML) - providing a detailed description of the warehouse logistics - the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) tool - identifying non-value adding activities - and a mathematical formulation of the so-called Genba Shikumi philosophy - ranking such system anomalies and assessing how they affect the warehouse. The subsequent reapplication of the VSM produces a complete picture of the reengineered warehouse, and using the UML tool allows describing in detail the updated system. By applying the presented methodology to the warehouse of an Italian interior design producer, we show that it represents a useful tool to systematically and dynamically improve the warehouse management. Indeed, the application of the approach to the company leads to an innovative proposal for the warehouse analysis and optimization: a warehouse management system that leads to increased profitability and quality as well as to reduced errors.},

In the cases when only one type of stock-keeping unit (SKU) is warehoused, or when multiple SKUs are warehoused, but, with separable inventory costs, closed form solutions are obtained for the optimalwarehouse size. For the case of multi-SKUs with joint inventory replenishment cost, a heuristic with a provable performance bound of 94{\%} is provided.},

By applying simplex routine, the optimal size of the warehouse to be constructed could be determined. In this paper, an alternative and simple method of arriving at an optimal solution for the static problem is given. Three extensions of the static model are given. These extensions involve costs varying over time, economies of scale in capital expenditure and/or operating cost and stochastic version. The dynamic warehouse sizing problem is shown to be a network flow problem which could be solved by using network flow algorithms. The structure of an optimal solution is also given. The concave cost version of the dynamic warehouse sizing problem is also discussed and it is shown that this problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. 0},
