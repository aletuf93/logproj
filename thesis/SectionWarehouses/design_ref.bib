abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis GroupIn order to differentiate from competitors in terms of customer service, warehouses accept late orders while providing delivery in a quick and timely way. This trend leads to a reduced time to pick an order. This paper introduces workload forecasting in a warehouse context, in particular a zone picking warehouse. Improved workforce planning can contribute to an effective and efficient order picking process. Most order picking publications treat demand as known in advance. As warehouses accept late orders, the assumption of a constant given demand is questioned in this paper. The objective of this study is to present time series forecasting models that perform well in a zone picking warehouse. A real-life case study demonstrates the value of applying time series forecasting models to forecast the daily number of order lines. The forecast of order lines, along with order pickers' productivity, can be used by warehouse supervisors to determine the daily required number of order pickers, as well as the allocation of order pickers across warehouse zones. Time series are applied on an aggregated level, as well as on a disaggregated zone level. Both bottom-up and top-down approaches are evaluated in order to find the best-performing forecasting method.},

abstract = {The paper focuses on the analysis and optimization of production warehouses, proposing a novel approach to reduce inefficiencies which employs three lean manufacturing tools in an integrated and iterative framework. The proposed approach integrates the Unified Modeling Language (UML) - providing a detailed description of the warehouse logistics - the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) tool - identifying non-value adding activities - and a mathematical formulation of the so-called Genba Shikumi philosophy - ranking such system anomalies and assessing how they affect the warehouse. The subsequent reapplication of the VSM produces a complete picture of the reengineered warehouse, and using the UML tool allows describing in detail the updated system. By applying the presented methodology to the warehouse of an Italian interior design producer, we show that it represents a useful tool to systematically and dynamically improve the warehouse management. Indeed, the application of the approach to the company leads to an innovative proposal for the warehouse analysis and optimization: a warehouse management system that leads to increased profitability and quality as well as to reduced errors.},

Efficient algorithms are currently only available to compute the optimal lane depth for a single product, assuming that all lanes have equal depth. In most warehouses, the lane depth on each side of a single aisle is kept constant for layout and material flow purposes. A layout procedure for selecting lane depths out of a limited number of allowable depths and for determining the number of lanes and aisles for each depth for the case of multiple products is developed. If the warehouse is perfectly balanced, then this procedure minimizes the required warehouse area. One component of the layout procedure is an algorithm to compute the optimal number of lanes and the optimal lane depths for a single product, when the lanes are allowed to have a limited number of different depths. The quality of this and other heuristics for the single product case is evaluated by comparing them to the optimal},

For a floor-storage system, storage can be accessed from the top of stacks only. The objective is to minimise the number of re-handling operations by optimally determining the storage location and by grouping products for each customer that fit a given sequence for receiving and retrieving operations. An integer programming model is formulated and an approximate solution technique based on the beam search method is proposed to solve the problem by incorporating effective heuristics to reduce the search space using future receiving and retrieving requests. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for industrial warehousing problems in a steel plant with 58 storage areas involving more than 3000 retrieving operations. The proposed solution method is shown to be more efficient than the traditional branch-and-bound method for solving integer programming problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Azadivar1989,
abstract = {The throughput capacity of an automated warehousing system is mainly dependent on two factors; the number of available storage spaces and the efficiency of the storage and retrieval system. If it is assumed that only a limited amount of resources are available to build a warehouse, spending most of the resources on providing more spaces or on a more efficient storage and retrieval system becomes a crucial allocation problem. In this paper, a warehouse consisting of two types of storage spaces, random access and rack space, is considered. Random access spaces are assumed to require more resources per unit to provide, but they contribute more to the efficiency of the operation of the system because items can be stored in and retrieved from them without delay. Rack spaces, on the other hand, need the services of a stacking crane for storage and retrieval. As a result, the queueing system formed limits their utilization. Here, a method is presented for the optimum allocation of the resources among these two types of spaces so that the overall throughput capacity of the warehouse is maximized. The problem is formulated and solved as a stochastic optimization problem and a numerical example is provided.},

In the optimal configuration, the travelled distance savings range from 7{\%} to 17{\%}. The loss of storage area related to the presence of the diagonal cross-aisles is, also, evaluated, leading to define the profitability regions, best balance between the distance saving and the storage area loss, driving the choice of the most effective number of diagonal cross-aisles to include within the storage system.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide a method to generate a three-dimensional detailed design of fishbone layouts. This method takes the desired storage capacity and returns the location (x,y,z) of each opening of the warehouse in such a way that the total operational cost - area cost and material handling cost - of the warehouse is minimal. We model the arrangement of the openings using mathematical finite sequences and represent a fishbone layout in terms of four primary characteristics. Next, we develop an algorithm that generates a detailed design of a fishbone layout given values of its four primary characteristics. Then, we present an optimization model that finds the values for the four primary characteristics that minimize the total operational cost of the warehouse. Finally, we solve the optimization model using a genetic algorithm. Our results suggest that in 91.74{\%} of the cases, our optimization procedure reaches a near optimum point - deviated only by 0.587{\%} - in a reasonable computational time (maximum 4.5. min). This paper aims to diminish dependence upon experts and human decision making in the process of implementing a fishbone layout on greenfield projects, and fulfills an identified need of warehouse practitioners by integrating the most recent advances on non-traditional layouts and detailed warehouse design.},

@article{Thomas2013,
abstract = {Warehouses can be characterized in many ways, including the number of items stored, the average number of cases per pallet, throughput and inventory requirements, and demand profile, to name a few. Thus, there is no one-size-fits-all design for case-picking warehouses, and hundreds of designs are possible. Moreover, the decision variables in warehouse design are interrelated and this further complicates the design process. The purpose of this paper is to provide a set of guidelines for arriving at a "good" design configuration for a manual, case-picking warehouse. Our goal in developing a set of guidelines is that it would provide a design that is close to the optimal solution, which could then be further analyzed and improved. We limit the decision variables considered in our analysis to include the size and layout of the forward area, dock door configuration, pallet area shape, and pallet rack height. To develop our design guidelines we employ a statistical-based methodology, whereby we use one set of data to develop the guidelines and an independent set of data to evaluate the performance of the guidelines. Our response variable is the number of labor hours. We use analytical models to evaluate labor hours for each design in the solution space. The most impactful parameter that influences our guidelines is using a forward area. Other parameters include: the ratio of SKUs to bottom-level pallet locations, ABC curve skewness, and number of lines per batch. Our results indicate that our guidelines provide a good design that minimizes labor hours.},

Consequently, they are widely used in industrial companies to manage products with cost-effective utilization of time, space and equipment. This paper presents a multi-parametric dynamic model of a product-to-picker storage system with class based storage allocation of products. Thousands of what-if scenarios are simulated in order to measure the impact of alternative design and operating configurations on the expected system performance and to identify the most critical factors and combinations of factors affecting the response of the system. Class based storage proves to be a very effective way of both reducing the picking cycle time and maximizing the throughput of the system. The rapid effectiveness of visual interactive simulation (VIS) in supporting the design (redesign) and control of new (existing) warehouses emerges, responding to the need for flexibility which modern companies need in order to adapt to strongly changing operating conditions quickly.},

An original and innovative model was developed in order to investigate the dwell point position for random allocation of unit loads. A software platform was developed to validate the proposed model by computer simulations. The performance of the system was analysed in a parametric/continuous way, varying at the same time the number of spans and levels, the height of the input/output point and the interval between requested missions. The results show that the developed model allowed convenience areas to be identified among the policies in which the travel time, distance travelled, and consequently warehousing costs are minimised, by varying different parameters. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {In today's competitive context, the paradigm of sustainable development is becoming more and more significant, also in warehousing. Managers are progressively considering not only purely economic aspects but also environmental concerns. Despite such consciousness, the selection of automated warehousing solutions has been mainly based on operational and economic performance in both practice and theory so far, whereas energy consumption and environmental performance have not been adequately taken into account. To fill this lack, a model is proposed to evaluate the energy consumption and environmental impact of automated warehousing solutions. The model has been used to investigate whether and how the selection of automated solutions changes depending on the dimensions involved in the analysis (i.e. only economic, only environmental or both). The analysis has been performed considering autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RSs) and its natural alternative, i.e. automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs). Results confirm the importance of considering both dimensions in the assessment of automated warehouses, as depending on the scenario, the technology selection shifts from AS/RS to AVS/RS when considering not only the economic but also the environmental impact. Additionally, this study provides new insights on the suitability areas of AVS/RSs.},

abstract = {Purpose – Since developing efficient product-location strategies represents a critical issue in operations management, due to its impact on warehouses performance in terms of both service level and operation costs, this paper aims to focus on possible improvements in the allocation of SKUs, numerically evaluating how these can lead to a reduction of both overall required warehouse space and material handling times. Design/methodology/approach – The undertaken approach focused on translating the warehouse management problem into a vertex colouring problem, modelling it as a multi-criteria problem and solving it through a properly modified algorithm. Findings – The heuristic validation on a real industrial case demonstrated its high optimization potential, and its benchmarking simulations showed performances significantly close to the best conceivable case. Indeed, though using a dedicated storage policy, the gained optimization value turned to be definitively close to the lower bound calculated through a randomized storage policy, which, differently from the proposed solution, must be inevitably supported by a warehouse management system software. Originality/value – This work presents an original multiproduct slot allocation heuristic developed by taking cue from vertex colouring problems and its pragmatic evaluation on a real industrial case; a benchmark with the randomized storage policy is also presented in order to underline the heuristic effectiveness and to point out possible future research opportunities.},

@article{Bottani2012,
abstract = {This paper explores the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimise item allocation in a warehouse, with the ultimate purpose of reducing the travel time of pickers, thus streamlining order picking operations. The GA is described along with a numerical example, reflecting a fast moving consumer goods warehouse, where items are assumed to be allocated according to a class-based storage system. Starting from that configuration, and taking into account the set of orders to be fulfilled, the GA identifies a new item allocation, which significantly decreases the travel distance (by approximately 20{\%}). This involves a corresponding decrease in the cost of picking operations, and allows the warehouse to respond quicker to the requests of customers. The GA and its numerical implementation are supported by a general purpose software, such as Microsoft Excel™, programmed under visual basic for applications; the resulting tool is thus easy to use in real scenarios.},

abstract = {One of the most significant activities in warehouse management concerns the allocation of products to the storage positions. This problem is known in the literature as the Product Allocation Problem (PAP). It mainly aims to optimize both the warehouse space utilization and the products handling costs (at least 40{\%} of the total logistics cost). This paper addresses the PAP in a multi-layer warehouse, with compatibility constraints among the product classes. It has already been addressed from a modeling point of view in the literature and it has been formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model. However, solving the problem to optimality becomes impracticable in real-life settings. To this purpose, an Iterated Local Search-based Heuristic (ILS) and a Cluster-based Heuristic (CH) have already been proposed in the literature. This paper presents a Rollout-based heuristic whose performances are evaluated on the basis of a detailed computational phase, including also a real case study and compared with those of both the ILS and the CH, in terms of the computational times and the quality of the final solutions.},

Our objective is to determine which replenishments minimize the expected amount of labor during the picking period. Further, we present a second model with a constraint on the replenishment activity.

@article{Walter2013,
abstract = {To reduce labor-intensive and costly order picking activities, many distribution centers are subdivided into a forward area and a reserve (or bulk) area. The former is a small area where most popular stock keeping units (SKUs) can conveniently be picked, and the latter is applied for replenishing the forward area and storing SKUs that are not assigned to the forward area at all. Clearly, reducing SKUs stored in forward area enables a more compact forward area (with reduced picking effort) but requires a more frequent replenishment. To tackle this basic trade-off, different versions of forward-reserve problems determine the SKUs to be stored in forward area, the space allocated to each SKU, and the overall size of the forward area. As previous research mainly focuses on simplified problem versions (denoted as fluid models), where the forward area can continuously be subdivided, we investigate discrete forward-reserve problems. Important subproblems are defined and computation complexity is investigated. Furthermore, we experimentally analyze the model gaps between the different fluid models and their discrete counterparts. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Yu2015,
abstract = {C lass-based storage is widely studied in the literature and applied in practice. It divides all stored items into a number of classes according to their turnover. A class of items with higher turnover is allocated to a region closer to the warehouse depot. In the literature, it has been shown that the use of more storage classes leads to a shorter travel time for storing and retrieving items. A basic assumption in this literature is that the required storage space for all items equals their average inventory level, which is valid only if an infinite number of items can be stored in each storage region. This study revisits class-based storage by considering each storage space to contain only a finite number of items. We develop a travel time model and an algorithm that can be used for determining the optimal number and boundaries of storage classes in warehouses. Different from the conventional research, our findings illustrate that commonly a small number of classes is optimal. In addition, we find the travel time is fairly insensitive to the number of storage classes in a wide range around the optimum. This suggests that a manager can select a near-optimal number of storage classes in an easy way and need not be worried about the impact of storage-class reconfigurations. We validate our findings for various cases, including different ABC-demand curves, space-sharing factors, number of items, storage rack shapes, discrete storage locations, and stochastic item demand.},

The problem becomes intractable when the warehouse faces variable supply and uncertain demand in a multi-period setting. We assume a factor-based de- mand model in which demand for each product in each period is affinely dependent on some uncertain factors. The distributions of these factors are only partially characterized. We introduce a robust optimization model that minimizes the worst-case expected total travel in the warehouse with distri- butional ambiguity of demand. Under a linear decision rule, we obtain a storage and retrieval policy by solving a moderate-size linear optimization problem. Surprisingly, despite imprecise specification of demand distributions, our computational studies suggest that the linear policy achieves close to the expected value given perfect information, and significantly outperforms existing heuristics in the literature.},

@article{Bortolini2015,
abstract = {The reports from the strong earthquakes that hit seismic regions, as Italy, frequently show the damages occurring to the storage systems and the collapse of their racks, with devastating social and economic consequences. The loads stored in such systems represent the most of their weight, so that the overall structure stability is expected to highly depend on the chosen storage assignment policy. Conventional approaches relate the load assignment to the storage/retrieval (S/R) travel time, affecting the handling costs, neglecting any further issue. This paper faces the so-called unit-load assignment problem (ULAP) for industrial warehouses located in seismic areas presenting an innovative integer linear programming (ILP) model. The model includes both the S/R travel time and an innovative stability condition for the rack collapse prevention during seismic events. A case study, based on a multi-scenario analysis, is discussed to show the benefits coming from the application of the proposed strategy and to assess the impact of the stability issues on the average single-command travel time. The key results outline the effectiveness of the proposed strategy revealing that significant improvements in the structure stability are achievable with little decrease of the S/R efficiency.

abstract = {The aim of this work is to address the products allocation problem in a multi-layers warehouse with compatibility constraints among the classes. The problem under study represents one of the most relevant topic in Logistics. The goal is to reduce, as much as possible, the delivery times; the inventories; the total logistic costs and to guarantee, at the same time, higher service levels (i.e., high customers satisfaction degree). In this work, a linear model to mathematically represent the problem is developed and its performance is evaluated on a set of instances, representing realistic situations. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out by considering the most relevant parameters of the model. Finally, an Iterated Local Search based heuristic is defined in order to solve large scale scenarios in a reasonable amount of time. Numerical results show that the proposed heuristic is able to find good quality solutions with a computational effort lower than that required to solve the proposed mathematical model. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Guo2016,
abstract = {The performance of a storage policy in a warehouse is usually evaluated on the basis of the average one-way travel distance/time needed to store/retrieve a load. Dividing the storage space into zones based on item turnover frequency can reduce the travel distance. However, for a given number of stored items, a larger number of storage zones also requires more storage space, because of reduced space sharing between the items, which increases travel time. This study considers the required space consumption by storage zoning in comparing the performance of random, full turnover-based and class-based storage policies for a unit-load warehouse operated by a forklift in single-command mode. A generalised travel distance model that considers the required space consumption is developed to compare the perfor-mance of these policies. Results show that the one-way travel distance of a random policy decreases with the increase in skewness of the demand curve. By considering the required space consumption, a class-based storage policy performs generally better than a full turnover-based policy. In addition, the optimal warehouse shape factor (ratio of warehouse width to depth) appears to decrease with the skewness of the demand curve. Warehouse managers are advised to adopt a wide-shallow warehouse layout when the item demands are approximately equal, whereas a narrow-deep layout is preferred when the demand curves are steep. 1. Introduction Warehouses play an important role in order fulfillment. They are the main point of contact with customers, responsible for meeting customer expectations set in the sales process. According to Handfield et al. (2013), warehouses are responsible for about 15{\%} of the total logistics cost in developed countries such as Germany (other components such as packaging, inventory, value addition, managing flows and returns handling are activities that also typically take place in the warehouse). Mayer et al. (2009) estimate the warehousing and inventory carrying costs to be more than 40{\%} of total logistics costs in Europe. Companies therefore focus on making warehouse operations efficient. Among these operations, retrieving items from their storage locations typically accounts for a high proportion of operational costs (Frazelle and Frazelle 2002; Tompkins et al. 2010), taking up to half of the total warehouse operating expense (De Koster et al. 2007). Class-based storage, which divides the stored items of a warehouse into different classes according to the ABC demand curve (the ranked turnover of the items), is commonly applied in practice and is widely studied in the literature (Rosenblatt and Eynan 1989; Eynan and Rosenblatt 1994; Kouvelis and Papanicolaou 1995; Gu, Goetschalckx, and McGinnis 2007). Two special cases are random storage, with only one storage class exists, and full turnover-based stor-age, where the number of classes equals the number of items. That is, under a random storage policy, all items share a common class, whereas with full turnover-based storage, each item has its own, dedicated, class. The required storage space (RSS) of items is important in warehouse management, particularly for warehouse design, storage policy selection and one-way travel distance evaluation. Existing research on class-based storage assumes that the RSS of an item equals its average inventory level (expressed in pallet quantities). Some well-known findings are based on this assumption. For example, the average one-way travel time for the storage and retrieval (S/R) machine to retrieve a unit-load in an automated storage and retrieval (AS/R) system with a normalised (to 1) square-in-time (SIT) rack, under a random storage policy equals 2/3 (Hausman, Schwarz, and Graves 1976). This value is not affected by the demand frequency curve of the stored items (i.e. the skewness of the demand curve; Hausman, Schwarz, and Graves 1976). Another well-known result is that the full turnover-based storage policy minimises the expected},

Recently, one of the authors has shown that the class of problems considered by Heskett can be formulated as a linear program, and that the CPO rule is in fact the optimal solution.

In particular, a class based storage assignment over a life cycle picking metric is adopted. This metric is a rolling measure of popularity. The proposed approach, the adopted measure of popularity and the developed models can support (1) decision making for the selection of warehousing and material handling (W{\&}MH) systems, (2) the determination of the storage capacity for the storage classes, (3) the assignment of SKU to the storage classes and (4) the dynamic, i.e., time-based, management of re-warehousing handlings.

abstract = {Class-based storage policy distributes products among a number of classes and for each class it reserves a region within the storage area. The procedures reported in the literature for formation of storage classes primarily consider order-picking cost ignoring storage-space cost. Moreover, in these procedures items are ordered on the basis of their cube per order index (COI), and items are then partitioned into classes maintaining this ordering. This excludes many possible product combinations in forming classes which may result in inferior solutions. In this paper, a simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) is developed to solve an integer programming model for class formation and storage assignment that considers all possible product combinations, storage-space cost and order-picking cost. Computational experience on randomly generated data sets and an industrial case shows that SAA gives superior results than the benchmark dynamic programming algorithm for class formation with COI ordering restriction. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Pan2015,
abstract = {An order storage assignment problem (SAP) is to find an effective way to locate products in a warehouse in order to improve the operational efficiency of order picking. Since SAP is an NP-hard problem, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed. Most of previous researches focused on picker-to-parts warehousing systems or automated storage and retrieval systems. However, pick-and-pass systems play an important role for the faster delivery of small and frequent orders of inventory with the rise of e-commerce and e-business in the global supply chain. Two factors lead to idle time of pickers in a pick-and-pass system: picking line imbalance and shortage replenishment of products. This paper develops a genetic based heuristic method to solve SAP for a pick-and-pass system with multiple pickers to determine the appropriate storage space for each product and balance the workload of each picking zone so that the performance of the system can be improved. A simulation model based on FlexSim is used to implement the proposed heuristic algorithm and compare the throughput for different storage assignment methods as well. The results indicate that the proposed heuristic policy outperforms existing assignment methods in a pick-and-pass system.},

Warehousing systems play a crucial role in providing efficiency and customer satisfaction. The warehouse design entails a wide set of decisions, which involve layout constraints and operative issues that seriously affect the performances and the overall logistics costs. This study presents an original decision-support system (DSS) for the design, management, and control of warehousing systems. Specifically, the proposed DSS implements a top-down methodology that considers both strategic warehouse design and operative operations management. The DSS can simulate the logistics and material handling performances of a warehousing system. Heuristic methods and algorithms address several critical warehouse issues, such as the order picking process, which is responsible for 55{\%} of the overall costs in a distribution centre. The benefits due to the adoption of the proposed decision-support system are summarised as a dashboard of key performance indicators (KPIs) of space and time efficiency that allow logistics providers, practitioners, and managers as well as academicians and educators to face real-world warehousing instances and to find useful guidelines for material handling. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Bindi2009,
abstract = {Today's distribution warehouses often need to process a far higher volume of smaller orders of multiple products which considerably increases logistics costs. They use the so-called order picking (OP) systems where products have to be picked from a set of specific storage locations by an OP process usually driven by production batches or customer orders. The OP is often very labour-intensive and its efficiency largely depends on the distance the order pickers have to travel, which therefore needs to be minimised. Minimising this distance is affected by several factors e.g. facility layout, shape of storage area, and especially the storage assignment strategy. Products that are frequently ordered together in multi-item, less than unit load customer orders should be stored near each other: this is the correlated storage assignment strategy. This study develops, tests and compares a set of different storage allocation rules based on the application of original similarity coefficients and clustering techniques. Lastly, a case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed rules in minimising logistic costs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Moshref-Javadi2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Taylor {\&} Francis A major part of warehouse operations is related to the collection of parts from the warehouse which is called the Order Picking Problem. To improve order picking operations, the total travel distance and generally picking time must be reduced. In this paper, a two-level approach is proposed that determines the locations of parts in the warehouse. The first step clusters parts into part families. Four different clustering methods based on principal component analysis, singular value decomposition and Two-Step Cluster Component are applied. In the second step, four different heuristics are proposed to determine the locations of parts. In addition to the minimisation of travel distance, we also consider the minimisation of the total congestion in aisles due to multiple workers. The proposed algorithms also consider the interactions between part families to minimise intergroup movements. As a result of the implementation, we achieved more than 40{\%} reduction in material handling compared to the current set-up of the warehouse. The applied algorithms can easily be modified to be used for warehouses with different configurations. The algorithms utilised in this case study can be helpful to researchers to become familiar with new heuristics, as well as practitioners to design improved warehouses.},

abstract = {Data mining has long been applied in information extraction for a wide range of applications such as customer relation- ship management in marketing. In the retailing industry, this technique is used to extract the consumers buying beha- viour when customers frequently purchase similar products together; in warehousing, it is also beneficial to store these correlated products nearby so as to reduce the order picking operating time and cost. In this paper, we present a data mining-based algorithm for storage location assignment of piece picking items in a randomised picker-to-parts warehouse by extracting and analysing the association relationships between different products in customer orders. The algorithm aims at minimising the total travel distances for both put-away and order picking operations. Extensive computational experiments based on synthetic data that simulates the operations of a computer and networking products spare parts warehouse in Hong Kong have been conducted to test the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm. Results show that our proposed algorithm is more efficient than the closest open location and purely dedicated storage allocation systems in minimising the total travel distances. The proposed storage allocation algorithm is further evaluated with experiments simulating larger scale warehouse operations. Similar results on the performance comparison among the three storage approaches are observed. It supports the proposed storage allocation algorithm and is applicable to improve the warehousing operation efficiency if items have strong association among each other.},

The demand dependences can be obtained from the products' bill of materials (BOMs) and production rates. Due to the large number of materials in a BOM, picking capacity constraint is explicitly considered. A mathematical model is formulated and heuristic algorithms are proposed, including two direct heuristics and two hybrid genetic algorithms with different crossover mechanisms. Numerical experimentation shows that the hybrid genetic algorithm with 2-point crossover outperforms others and can be practical in warehouse design. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] },

Due to the computational time required for solving the integer programming problem, a faster genetic algorithm is also developed to form optimal batches and optimal routes for the order picker.

The authors use a simulation model based on the operations of a distribution center that is currently picking one order at a time, storing product in a haphazard or random fashion, and using a simplistic procedure for routing pickers. Several picking, storage, and routing policies are evaluated to determine which process decision provides the greatest percent savings relative to the current baseline policies. Several sensitivity analyses are completed to examine the effect of order size, warehouse shape, location of pick-up/drop-off point, and demand distribution on performance. Results show that batching of orders yield the greatest savings particularly when smaller order sizes are common. Results also show the use of either a class-based or volume-based storage policy provides nearly the same level of savings as batching, while being less sensitive to the average order size. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Concurrently, control policies such as storage policies and routing are considered. Simulation is utilised to determine the performance of the various resulting scenarios. A screening and selection procedure is employed to reduce the required number of replications while achieving a predetermined precision in identifying the best configuration. The approach is applied for an industrial partner in this research and the results of experimentation are compared to a baseline scenario which describes a proposed new facility in the Netherlands.

@article{Chen2005a,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of constructing order batches for distribution centers using a data mining technique. With the advent of supply chain management, distribution centers fulfill a strategic role of achieving the logistics objectives of shorter cycle times, lower inventories, lower costs and better customer service. Many companies consider both their cost effectiveness and market proficiency to depend primarily on efficient logistics management. Warehouse management system (WMS) presently is considered a key to strengthening company logistics. Order picking is routine in distribution centers. Before picking a large set of orders, effectively grouping orders into batches can accelerate product movement within the storage zone. The order batching procedure has to be implemented in WMS and may be run online many times daily. The literature has proposed numerous batching heuristics for minimizing travel distance or travel time. This paper presents a clustering procedure for an order batching problem in a distribution center with a parallel-aisle layout. A data mining technique of association rule mining is adopted to develop the order clustering approach. Performance comparisons between the developed approach and existing heuristics are given for various problems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this work we investigate the problem of order batching and picker routing in storage areas. These are labour and capital intensive problems, often responsible for a substantial share of warehouse operating costs. In particular, we consider the case of online grocery shopping in which orders may be composed of dozens of items. We present a formulation for the problem based on an exponential number of connectivity constraints and we introduce a significant number of valid inequalities based on the standard layout of warehouses, composed of parallel aisles and two or more cross-aisles. The proposed inequalities are highly effective and greatly improve computational results. Instances involving up to 20 orders are solved to proven optimality when we jointly consider order batching and picker routing. Instances involving up to 5000 orders are considered where order batching is done heuristically, but picker routing is done optimally.},

@article{Zulj2018,
abstract = {Given a set of customer orders and a routing policy, the goal of the order-batching problem (OBP) is to group customer orders to picking orders (batches) such that the total length of all tours through a rectangular warehouse is minimized. Because order picking is considered the most labor-intensive process in warehousing, effectively batching customer orders can result in considerable savings. The OBP is NP-hard if the number of orders per batch is greater than two, and the exact solution methods proposed in the literature are not able to consistently solve larger instances. To address larger instances, we develop a metaheuristic hybrid based on adaptive large neighborhood search and tabu search, called ALNS/TS. In numerical studies, we conduct an extensive comparison of ALNS/TS to all previously published OBP methods that have used standard benchmark sets to investigate their performance. ALNS/TS outperforms all comparison methods with respect to both average solution quality and run-time. Compared to the state-of-the-art, ALNS/TS shows the clearest advantages on the larger instances of the existing benchmark sets, which assume a higher number of customer orders and higher capacities of the picking device. Finally, ALNS/TS is able to solve newly generated large-scale instances with up to 600 customer orders and six articles per customer order with reasonable run-times and convincing scaling behavior and robustness.},

@article{Lu2016,
abstract = {Warehousing has been traditionally viewed as a non-value-adding activity but in recent years a number of new developments have meant that supply chain logistics have become critical to profitability. This paper focuses specifically on order-picking which is a key factor affecting warehouse performance. Order picking is the operation of retrieving goods from specified storage locations based on customer orders. Today's warehouses face challenges for greater responsiveness to customer orders that require more flexibility than conventional strategies can offer. Hence, dynamic order-picking strategies that allow for changes of pick-lists during a pick cycle have attracted attention recently. In this paper we introduce an interventionist routing algorithm for optimising the dynamic order-picking routes. The algorithm is tested using a set of simulations based on an industrial case example. The results indicate that under a range of conditions, the proposed interventionist routing algorithm can outperform both static and heuristic dynamic order-picking routing algorithms.},

@article{Roodbergen2001,
abstract = {This paper considers routing and layout issues for parallel aisle warehouses. In such warehouses order pickers walk or drive along the aisles to pick products fromstorage. They can change aisles at a number of cross aisles. These cross aisles are usually located at the front and the back of the warehouse, but there can also be one or more cross aisles at positions in between. We describe a number of heuristics to determine order picking routes in a warehouse with two or more cross aisles. To analyse the performance of the heuristics, a branch-and-bound algorithm that generates shortest order picking routes is used. Performance com- parisons between heuristics and the branch-and-bound algorithm are given for various warehouse layouts and order sizes. For the majority of the instances with more than two cross aisles, a newly developed heuristic appears to perform better than the existing heuristics. Furthermore, some consequences for layout are dis- cussed. From the results it appears that the addition of cross aisles to the ware- house layout can decrease the handling time of the orders by lowering average travel times. However, adding a large number of cross aislesmay increase average travel times because the space occupied by the cross aisles has to be traversed as well.},

We give analytical formulas that can be used to calculate the average length of an order picking route under two different routing policies. The optimal layout can be determined by using these formulas as the objective function in a nonlinear programming model. The optimal number of aisles in an order picking area appears to depend strongly on the required storage space and the pick list size. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
